# Environmental and Maternal Imprints on Infant Gut Metabolic Programming

__Abstract:__ Early life is a critical period for immune and metabolic programming, but developmental patterns remain underexplored in populations from low- and middle-income countries. Here, we profile the microbiome and metabolome of 55 Bangladeshi mother-infant dyads over the first six months of life. Importantly, we observed an increase in microbially-derived bile amidates and N-acyl lipids with age in conjunction with reads matching the bile salt hydrolase/transferase (bsh) gene. While microbial source tracking confirmed maternal fecal seeding, a substantial environmental contribution was also highlighted. Differences in infant fecal metabolic profiles were associated with delivery mode, maternal milk composition, household assets, and household-level water treatment. C-section delivery and untreated drinking water were linked to transient metabolic differences, including increases in bile amidates, N-acyl lipids, and other host-microbe co-metabolic products, including acylcarnitines. Multi-omics analysis revealed specific microbial-metabolite relationships, highlighting how early environmental and maternal living circumstances  shape metabolic gut programming through the microbiome.
